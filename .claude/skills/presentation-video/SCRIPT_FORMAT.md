## Field Definitions

### Master Prompt

The master prompt appears at the top and sets constraints for the entire script:
- **MAX_DURATION**: Maximum seconds per slide (default: 60)
- **Speaking pace**: 130-150 words per minute is natural
- **Word limit**: Approximately MAX_DURATION * 2.5 words

### Slide Sections

Each slide section contains:

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **SLIDE N** | Slide number and title from the slide | `## SLIDE 3: Build a Core That Lasts` |
| **Duration** | Target time range | `**Duration:** 45-55 seconds` |
| **Tone** | Emotional direction for delivery | `**Tone:** Inspiring, urgent` |
| **Voice-Over** | The actual narration text | Full paragraphs of narration |

### Tone Options

Common tone descriptors:
- **Opening slides**: Inspiring, inviting, setting the stage
- **Problem slides**: Urgent, concerned, empathetic
- **Solution slides**: Confident, practical, encouraging
- **Example slides**: Storytelling, engaging, illustrative
- **Summary slides**: Authoritative, summarizing
- **Closing slides**: Memorable, call-to-action, motivating

## Writing Guidelines

### Content Guidelines

1. **Use context documents**: Incorporate examples, case studies, and deeper explanations from source materials
2. **Maintain flow**: Each slide should connect to the previous and next
3. **Tell stories**: Use specific examples and anecdotes
4. **Be conversational**: Write for spoken delivery, not reading
5. **End strong**: Final slide should be a memorable call-to-action

### Duration Guidelines

| Max Duration | Word Count | Best For |
|--------------|------------|----------|
| 30 seconds | ~75 words | Quick transitions, simple concepts |
| 45 seconds | ~110 words | Standard content slides |
| 60 seconds | ~150 words | Complex concepts, stories |
| 90 seconds | ~225 words | Deep dives (use sparingly) |

### Structure Guidelines

1. **Hook first**: Start each slide with an engaging opening
2. **One main idea**: Each slide should convey one primary concept
3. **Concrete examples**: Abstract ideas need specific illustrations
4. **Clear transitions**: Signal when moving to the next concept

## Example

```markdown
## SLIDE 5: Make a Stand for Something You Care About
**Duration:** 50-60 seconds
**Tone:** Passionate, principled

### Voice-Over:
The only way to attain the sense of urgency and devotion that running a successful company requires is by doing something that matters to you.

An exit strategy is not a business plan. Starting with the goal of selling out is like entering a relationship with the aim of breaking up—it's absurd.

Build something based on commitment and passion.

Consider Vinnie's Sub Shop in Chicago. They stop selling sandwiches in the afternoon because the bread is no longer fresh. The extra income they could earn isn't worth the loss of pride from selling mediocre food.

Their customers love this devotion to freshness.

When you make a stand for what you believe in, you attract loyal followers.

## Parsing

The `essai audio` command parses this format by:
1. Finding `## SLIDE N:` headers
2. Extracting text after `### Voice-Over:`
3. Generating one audio file per slide: `slide_01.wav`, `slide_02.wav`, etc.
